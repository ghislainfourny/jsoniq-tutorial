# JSONiq for JSON users
This tutorial introduces the JSONiq language, which declaratively manipulates JSON data.

# Live version

It was moved to an interactive, live tutorial that can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/RumbleDB/rumble/blob/master/RumbleSandbox.ipynb).

# Static version

A user-friendly display of the tutorial is located [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ghislainfourny/jsoniq-tutorial/blob/master/JSONiq-tutorial.ipynb), if you just want to take a look with no setup: just ignore the instructions and scroll your way down.

# Running JSONiq on your own laptop or cluster

You can also install RumbleDB to your laptop, or use it on a large cluster (Amazon EMR, Azure HDInsight, Google Cloud...). The documentation is [here](https://rumble.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Getting%20started/).

## Zorba

The queries in the notebook also can be run on a local installation of [Zorba](http://zorba.io). However, Zorba is no longer officially maintained.
